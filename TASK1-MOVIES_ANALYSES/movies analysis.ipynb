Problem statement\n\nThe dataset consists of 1000 movies information over the period (2006-2016) with various variables. Such as,          Title, Year of release, Revenue, Ratings, Votes, Actors and Genres. Insights from this dataset guides Producers, Distributors, Theatres and Others in understanding the movies trend in all the aspects.\n\n\n<a id=section101></a>\n### 1.1 Introduction:\n\nThis Exploratory Data Analysis is to practice Python skills learned till now on a structured data set including      loading, inspecting, wrangling, exploring, and drawing conclusions from data. The notebook has observations with      each step in order to explain thoroughly how to approach the data set.

So this is a good space for the new directors, at the same time they would help avoid competition.\n- Most of the existing directors are concentrating on the genres: Action, Adventure and Sci-Fi even though they are not doing well commercially. Hence, Directors should start combinations of those with well performed genres such as, Drama, Comedy and Romance.\n- There are movies with higher metrics of rating, metascore and votes but, they have not done well in terms of revenue. So, These movies can be pushed to OTT platforms for further revenue generation.\n- Distributors can safely opt for the movies involving the Actors: Malin Akarmen, Mia Goth, Susan Loughnane, Michael Varten, Laura Dern, Roman Kolinka and Joan Allen, And the Directors: Alexandre Aja, Paul Anderson, Ridley Scott and Woody Allen.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
